Direct feedback from the research community has been an integral part of the Network Canvas project from the start. Your feedback and ideas help us continue improving this tool for the whole community.

With that in mind, we have recently launched a new purpose-built community website for Network Canvas. This site is a place for you to share your thoughts, ideas, and experiences with the Network Canvas
team and other users. You can also find out about the latest updates and developments in the project.

<div style="text-align:center; margin: 2.4rem">
<button class="btn btn--md">
  <a href="https://community.networkcanvas.com" target="_blank">Visit the Community Site</a>
</button>
</div>

For those technically-minded, visit our [github pages](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/) to join development discussions and provide your feedback there.

Finally, if you would like to privately discuss collaboration or consultation, the project team can be reached by emailing [info@networkcanvas.com](mailto:info@networkcanvas.com).

We look forward to hearing from you!
